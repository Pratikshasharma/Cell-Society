### Blake Becerra, Ryan Anders, and Pratiksha Sharma
__________

Date Started - Sept. 15
Date Finished - Oct. 5
Hours spent - approx. 45 - 55 per person
each person's role in developing the project

###roles:

Blake Becerra - Back end and logic for the Simulations
Ryan Anders - Back end and XML documentation
Pratiksha Sharma - Front End and integration of back end

###resources:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java_xml/index.htm

We all consulted our TA’s, Javadoc’s, and the above link for XML parsing.

###files containing main:

Main.java 

###files for testing:

XML files included in the data folder:

- Fire.xml
- GameOfLife.xml
- PredPrey.xml
- Segregation.xml
- SlimeMold.xml

###resources required for project:

In the resources folder there is a Button.properties that is required for the program to run and display correctly.

###program use:

Run main, hit “Open File” and choose an XML file, then press either “Step” (to move forward one “tick”) or “Start” (to set the simulation in motion).

###bugs:

BUG: when no sharks remain in Predator-Prey, the Fish do not populate every cell after several turns.
BUG: SlimeMold does not change states of the slime correctly and releases only a set amount of cAMP when it moves. 

###extra features:

Graph showing population of states
XML Error Checking - exceptions thrown
Added Slime Mold simulation

###impressions for the future:

Extension Simulation directions were unclear and confusing making it harder to implement and extend because we could not test our logic.
